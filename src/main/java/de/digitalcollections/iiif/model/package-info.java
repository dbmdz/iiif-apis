 *
 * <p>To ensure that the resulting JSON is compliant with the IIIF specification, it is necessary to
 * use the contained Jackson object mapper ({@link
 * de.digitalcollections.iiif.model.jackson.IiifObjectMapper}), merely using the {@link
 * de.digitalcollections.iiif.model.jackson.IiifModule} is not sufficient, since a lot of custom
 * code was necessary to achieve compliance, more than what is available with Jackson modules. If
 * you want to override or extend the settings, just subclass the ObjectMapper.
